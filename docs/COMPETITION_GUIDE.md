## 1. Game Overview

**Bomberland** is a tactical strategy game inspired by the classic [Bomb IT](https://gamevui.vn/bom-it-7/game). 4 agents compete on a **13×13** grid map (playing area of 11×11). Agents' mission: move, place bombs, destroy boxes, collect items, and eliminate opponents.

### Map

- Size: **13×13** (11x11 play area, 1 tile thick border of walls).
- Randomly generated per match using a `seed` - guaranteed to be **fully connected** (no isolated areas).
- Contains 4 types of tiles:

| Symbol | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Grass | Walkable, bombs can be placed here |
| `1` | Wall | Indestructible, blocks explosions |
| `2` | Box | Can be destroyed by bombs; may drop items when destroyed |
| `3` | Item: Radius | Collect to increase bomb radius by +1 |
| `4` | Item: Capacity | Collect to increase bomb capacity by +1 |

### Starting Positions

The 4 agents start at the **4 corners** of the map:

- Agent 0: `(1, 1)` - Top-left
- Agent 1: `(11, 11)` - Bottom-right
- Agent 2: `(1, 11)` - Top-right
- Agent 3: `(11, 1)` - Bottom-left

The 2×2 area around each corner is guaranteed to be empty (no boxes, no walls) to prevent agents from being stuck at the start.

---

## 2. Game Mechanics

### Resolution

Each game step is processed in the following order:

```
Collect Actions → Process Movement → Place Bombs → Decrease Bomb Timers → Resolve Explosions → Remove Agents → Spawn Items → Check End Conditions
```

### Agent Actions

Each step, the agent returns **1 integer**:

| Value | Action |
|---|---|
| `0` | STOP (stay still) |
| `1` | LEFT |
| `2` | RIGHT |
| `3` | UP |
| `4` | DOWN |
| `5` | PLACE_BOMB |

**Movement Rules:**
- Cannot move through walls (`1`) or boxes (`2`).
- **Cannot move through bombs** from previous steps (bombs already on the floor) except for when an agent standing on the same tile where they just placed a bomb can still move away.
- Multiple agents **can stand on the same tile**.
- If multiple agents step on an item tile simultaneously → the item is destroyed (no one gets it).

### Bomb Mechanics

**Default Parameters:**
- Timer: **7 steps** (counts down from 7 to 0, explodes when ≤ 0)
- Default Radius: **1** (increases with collected items)
- Initial Capacity: **1** (increases with items)
- Maximum Radius: **5**, Maximum Capacity: **5**

**Placement Rules:**
- Can only place if `bombs_left > 0`.
- Cannot place on a tile that already has a bomb from a previous step.
- If multiple agents place a bomb on the **same tile in the same step** → the engine processes agents by ID (0 → 3). A bomb from a later agent **only overwrites** the previous one if its radius is **strictly larger**. Specific results:
  - Different radii → keep the bomb with the **larger radius** (regardless of agent ID).
  - Equal radii → keep the bomb of the **agent with the smaller ID** (as they were processed first).
  - Only the **owner of the kept bomb** will have their `bombs_left` decremented.
- Only the **placer** consumes `bombs_left`. The bomb remains and will explode even if the owner is eliminated.

**Explosion Mechanics:**
- Bombs explode in **4 directions** (Up, Down, Left, Right) with the set radius.
- Explosions **stop at walls** (cannot pass through).
- Explosions **stop at boxes** and **destroy them** (cannot pass through further).
- Explosions **pass through agents** (not blocked by players).
- Explosions last for only **1 step**.
- **Chain reaction**: If an explosion touches another bomb, that bomb explodes immediately in the same step.

**When a Box is Destroyed:**
- 30% chance to drop `Item Radius` (+1 bomb radius)
- 30% chance to drop `Item Capacity` (+1 bomb capacity)
- 40% chance to drop nothing

**Auto-spawning Items:**
Each step, every empty grass tile (no agent present) has a small chance to spawn an item:
- Probability increases over time: `P = 0.0003 × (step / 165)`
- 50% Radius, 50% Capacity

**When an Agent is Eliminated:**
- Any agent standing on a tile affected by an explosion is **immediately eliminated**.
- Eliminated agents can no longer act. However, bombs placed before death remain on the map and explode as usual.

**Self-destruct:** Agent can self destroyed :- ).

### Match Conclusion

The match ends when:
- **≤ 1 agent remains alive** (`terminated = True`), or
- Reaches **500 steps** (`truncated = True`)

## 4. Agent Structure & Submission Requirements

### ZIP File Structure

The submission must be a `.zip` file containing **exactly one `agent.py`** file:

```
submission.zip
├── agent.py          ← Required, unique
├── model.pth         ← (optional, for DRL)
└── ...               ← (optional, weights, small configs, etc.)
```

### File Limits

| Criteria | Limit |
|---|---|
| ZIP file size | ≤ 100 MB |
| Total extracted size | ≤ 300 MB |
| Single file size | ≤ 150 MB |
| Max number of files | ≤ 20 files |
| Allowed extensions | `.py`, `.txt`, `.pt`, `.pth`, `.pkl`, `.onnx`, `.bin`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.md`, `.h5`, `.pb`, `.keras`, `.tflite` |

### Required Agent Class

The `agent.py` file **must** define an `Agent` class with the following interface:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: int):
        # agent_id: 0, 1, 2, or 3
        self.agent_id = agent_id

    def act(self, obs: dict) -> int:
        # obs: dict containing 'map', 'players', 'bombs'
        # Returns: int in [0, 5]
        ...
```

**`agent_id`?**
- An integer from `0` to `3` assigned automatically by the engine. It tells your agent which player it is controlling. 
- Use `self.agent_id` to index into the `obs["players"]` list to find your own coordinates, health, and bomb stats. For example, `my_data = obs["players"][self.agent_id]`.

### Observation (obs) received each step

```python
obs = {
    "map":     np.ndarray,  # shape (13, 13), dtype int
                            # 0=Grass, 1=Wall, 2=Box, 3=Item_Radius, 4=Item_Capacity
    "players": np.ndarray,  # shape (4, 5), dtype int8
                            # Each row: [row, col, alive, bombs_left, bomb_radius_bonus]
    "bombs":   np.ndarray,  # shape (N, 4), dtype int8, N = current number of bombs
                            # Each row: [row, col, timer, owner_id]
}
```

**Notes:**
- `alive`: 1 = alive, 0 = eliminated
- `bomb_radius_bonus`: bonus added to radius (Actual radius = 1 + bonus)
- `bombs_left`: number of bombs available to place
- Agents receive **full state**.

### Time Constraints

- **Startup timeout:** Agent must finish loading within **20 seconds**.
- **Inference timeout:** Each call to `act()` must return within **100ms**. If exceeded → action defaults to `0` (STOP).

### Important Rules

- ❌ **No LLMs allowed** (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) inside the `Agent` class.
- ❌ **No copying code** from other teams.
- ❌ **Import Restrictions:** You may only `import` libraries that are pre-installed in the evaluation environment (see `requirements.txt`). Any attempt to import an unlisted library (e.g., `import langchain`) will cause your agent to crash.
- ✅ **Major Libraries Allowed:** `numpy`, `scipy`, `torch` (PyTorch), `tensorflow`, `stable-baselines3`, `gymnasium`, `onnxruntime`, and all Python standard libraries.
- ✅ **Checkpoints:** Allowed to load pre-trained models from files inside your ZIP (e.g., `.pth`, `.onnx`, `.h5`, `.tflite`).
- ✅ **Independent Submissions:** Each submission is treated as an agent with its own rating.

## 5. Scoring System & Leaderboard

### Scoring: TrueSkill

The system uses the [**TrueSkill**](https://trueskill.org/) algorithm (Microsoft Research) to estimate the skill level of each agent. Each submission is characterized by:

- **μ (mu):** Estimated average skill
- **σ (sigma):** Uncertainty (sigma decreases as more matches are played)
- **Score = μ - 3σ:** Conservative score used for ranking - ensures agents with enough matches are ranked higher.

Default starting values: `μ = 100.0, σ = 33.333`.

### Match Results

Each match has 4 agents. Ranking in the match is determined by **elimination order**:
- Last agent alive (or surviving until the end) = Best rank
- First agent eliminated = Worst rank
- Agents eliminated in the same step → Draw (shared rank)

**Win/Draw/Loss:**
Determined by match ranking:
- **Win:** Achieving the unique best rank in the match (e.g., last one alive, or sole survivor at time limit).
- **Draw:** Sharing the best rank with other agents (e.g., multiple agents eliminated in the same final step, or multiple survivors at 500 steps).
- **Loss:** Failing to achieve the best rank (eliminated before the winner).

### Leaderboard

Ranking priority (tie-break):

1. **Higher** `Score = μ − 3σ`
2. If equal: **Higher** `μ`
3. If still equal: **Lower** `σ`
4. If still equal: **Most recent submission**

### Automated Evaluation System

**Immediately upon submission:**
1. Server downloads ZIP from Google Drive.
2. Structure and syntax check.
3. If valid → immediately trigger **a batch of 12 matches** for initial rating. Opponents are sampled from the Active Pool (Ratio: 40% similar rating, 30% top tier, 30% random).
4. Update Google Sheets leaderboard.

**Background Job (Continuous):**
- Workers run continuously in cycles: each cycle runs **5 matches**, followed by a 10-second rest.
- Each match is sampled from the **Active Pool**, ensuring at least 1 student agent is involved.

### Active Pool

The system automatically maintains a pool of eligible agents for matchmaking:

| Criteria | Description |
|---|---|
| All Baselines | Always in the pool |
| Best per Team | Each team's highest-scoring submission |
| Recent per Team | Each team's 2 most recent submissions |
| Top Global | Top 10 global submissions (with ≥ 10 matches) |

---

## 6. Baseline Agents

There are **6 rule-based baseline agents** with fixed ratings (do not change during the competition):
